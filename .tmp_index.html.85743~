CAREFULLY READ THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT.  BY CLICKING ON THE “ACCEPT” BUTTON ACCOMPANYING THIS SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT OR BY USING THE PATHGEO SERVICE, YOU INDICATE THE ACCEPTANCE OF THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THEM.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU MAY NOT USE THE PATHGEO SERVICE.
<br>
THIS SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT CONSTITUTES THE COMPLETE AND EXCLUSIVE STATEMENT OF THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND PATHGEO WITH RESPECT TO THE PATHGEO SERVICE AND SUPERSEDES ANY PROPOSAL OR PRIOR AGREEMENT, ORAL OR WRITTEN, AND ANY OTHER COMMUNICATIONS RELATING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT. 

By clicking on the “Accept” button accompanying this Subscription Agreement (the “Agreement”) or by using the PathGeo Services (as defined below) accompanying this Agreement, you (hereafter “Client”) shall be deemed to have accepted and agreed to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement.  As used in this Agreement, “PathGeo” shall mean PathGeo Inc. and any Affiliate of PathGeo Inc. that provides software and/or services to Client.  Each of PathGeo and Client are referred to in this Agreement as a “Party” and collectively as the “Parties.”  This Agreement is effective as of the date it is accepted by Client (“Effective Date”).  Now therefore, for mutually agreeable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:

1.	DEFINITIONS 
1.1.	“Affiliate” means any entity that is a subsidiary or parent of Client or is more than 50% owned by Client’s parent entity.  
1.2.	“PathGeo Services” means a web-based platform that provides clients with the ability to conduct marketing analysis and to monitor customer feedback, and to perform business actions with integrated Geographic Information System (“GIS”) analytics with big data (web pages, social media websites, etc.).

2.	SERVICES
2.1.	Access and Scope of Use.  PathGeo agrees to provide Client with access to the PathGeo Services (via a password-protected website) to allow Client to analyze customer data, preferences and demographics for Client’s internal business purposes.  Client acknowledges that the use of the PathGeo Services permitted hereunder is strictly limited to Client’s and its Affiliates’ business purposes and that Client agrees that it shall not provide access to the PathGeo Services (whether through sharing its user name and password or otherwise) to any third party nor will it use the PathGeo Services for the benefit of any third party (whether on a service bureau or other outsourced basis).  
2.2.	Changes; Maintenance; Version Upgrades.  Client acknowledges that the PathGeo Services are not a static service and that PathGeo reserves the right (but does not undertake the obligation) to make changes to the PathGeo Services.  During any period in which Client is current in its maintenance fees, PathGeo will provide bug correction and maintenance services for defects in the PathGeo Services.  For version upgrades to the PathGeo Services (i.e., those that provide additional functionality and features), PathGeo reserves the right to charge Client for enhancements to the features and functionality of the PathGeo Services.  Nothing in this Agreement shall obligate PathGeo to continue to provide access to the PathGeo Services after the termination or expiration of this Agreement and nothing herein shall prevent PathGeo from discontinuing product support and maintenance services for the PathGeo Services.  
2.3.	Business Recovery.  PathGeo’s business recovery plan is designed to minimize, but not eliminate, risks associated with a disaster affecting the PathGeo data center supporting the PathGeo Services.  PathGeo does not warrant that the PathGeo Services will be uninterrupted or error free. Client is responsible for adopting a business recovery plan relating to disasters affecting Client’s facilities and for securing business interruption insurance or other insurance necessary for Client’s protection.  PathGeo shall maintain commercially reasonable backup procedures including storage of duplicate record files.  In the event of a service disruption due to reasons beyond PathGeo’s control, PathGeo shall use diligent efforts to mitigate the effects of such disruption and restore services.
2.4.	Network Connectivity and Hardware.  Client will provide at its own expense all equipment, computer software, network equipment, communication lines, and interface devices at Client’s locations required to access the PathGeo Services.  
2.5.	Exclusions.  PathGeo shall not be responsible for (i) telecommunications or Internet failures or outages, (ii) service interruptions due to disasters, acts of God, or any other act, omission or event beyond PathGeo’s control, (iii) delay or failure of any third party courier or delivery service, (iv) any problem caused by improper use of the PathGeo Services by Client, its Affiliates or any of their respective employees, agents or contractors, (vi) or any security breach of PathGeo or Client’s or its Affiliates’ systems by a hacker, virus, worm, or other intentional in person or electronic interference provided that PathGeo has made reasonable commercial efforts to protect its data and systems.
2.6.	Terms of Use.  Client will comply with PathGeo’s written terms of use as in effect from time to time.   
2.7.	Privacy and Collection of Information.  In the use of its websites with its customers, Client warrants that it will comply with all applicable law, including laws relating to privacy, the collection of personal information and allowing customers to make choices regarding the sharing of information.  

3.	TERM AND TERMINATION
3.1.	Month-to-Month Term.

3.2.	Termination by PathGeo.  PathGeo may terminate this Agreement and/or the provision of any of the PathGeo Services at any time for any reason with or without notice to Client, including any improper use of the PathGeo Services or Client’s failure to comply with this Agreement.  Such termination shall not affect any right to relief to which PathGeo and its third party providers and distributors may be entitled, at law or in equity.  Upon termination of this Agreement, all rights granted to Client will terminate and revert to PathGeo and their third party providers or distributors, as applicable.
3.3.	Effect of Termination.  Any termination or expiration of this Agreement shall not affect any rights or obligations of the Parties that arose prior to such termination or expiration, including without limitation the obligation to make payments then due.

(b)	Indemnitee shall give written notice (a “Notice of Claim”) to the Indemnitor within 10 business days after the Indemnitee has knowledge of any claim which an Indemnitee has determined has given or could give rise to a right of indemnification under this Agreement.  No failure to give such Notice of Claim within 10 business days as aforesaid shall affect the indemnification obligations of the Indemnitor hereunder, except to the extent Indemnitor can demonstrate such failure materially prejudiced such Indemnitor’s ability to successfully defend the matter giving rise to the claim.  The Notice of Claim shall state the nature of the claim, the amount of the Losses, if known, and the method of computation thereof, all with reasonable particularity and containing a reference to the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such right of indemnification is claimed or arises.  The Indemnitor shall have the right to direct the defense of any such claim at its expense through counsel chosen by it and Indemnitor shall have the right to settle such claim on terms and conditions as it deems appropriate, provided that any settlement does not require Indemnitee to admit liability, provide for injunctive relief against Indemnitee or compromise any of Indemnitee’s intellectual property rights.       
(c)	The indemnity remedies provided in Sections 9.1 and 9.2 shall be a Party’s exclusive remedy for the recovery of Losses resulting from, relating to or arising out of claims by third parties relating to this Agreement.

10.2.	Warranty Disclaimer.  THE PATHGEO SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” WITH NO WARRANTY WHATSOEVER.

If Client experiences a change of control, any license granted or services agreed to pursuant to this Agreement shall not inure to the benefit of affiliated entities.
